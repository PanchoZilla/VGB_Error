# VGB_Error
Sample gesture database
The gesture to detect here is really simple: The user just needs to raise both of his arms at his/her head level. 
Only one clip is included, and is used for both training and analysis. It has first been recorded as a raw '.xrf' file and successfully converted to '.xef' format using KSConvert.
